Here’s a sample README for your group chat project using WebSockets, Spring Boot, and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

# Group Chat Application

This is a real-time group chat application built using **WebSockets** for communication. The backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, while the frontend uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the user interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are delivered instantly to all connected users using WebSocket technology.
- **Group Chat**: Multiple users can join the chat room and communicate in real time.
- **User Notifications**: Users are notified when someone joins or leaves the chat.
- **Simple and Responsive UI**: The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Spring Boot**: Java-based framework to handle WebSocket connections and manage the chat server.
- **WebSocket**: Protocol for real-time communication between client and server.

### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the chat interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for a responsive and visually appealing UI.
- **JavaScript**: Handles WebSocket connections and dynamic updates to the chat interface.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Java 17+** installed on your machine.
- **Maven** to manage project dependencies.
- **Web browser** for running the frontend.

### Backend Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/group-chat-websocket.git
   cd group-chat-websocket
   ```
   
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup:
1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `frontend` directory in your web browser.

2. The chat UI should appear, and you can start chatting by entering a message and pressing the send button.

### WebSocket Endpoint:
- The WebSocket connection is established at the following endpoint:
  ```
  ws://localhost:8080/chat
  ```

## Usage

1. Open multiple instances of the `index.html` file in different browser tabs to simulate multiple users.
2. Enter your messages in the input box and click the send button or press "Enter" to broadcast the message.
3. You will see real-time updates from all connected users.

## Project Structure

```bash
group-chat-websocket/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/example/chat/
│   │   │       ├── config/        # WebSocket configuration
│   │   │       ├── controller/    # WebSocket message handling
│   │   │       └── model/         # Chat message model
│   └── resources/
│       └── application.properties # Spring Boot properties
└── frontend/
    ├── index.html                 # Chat UI
    ├── style.css                  # Chat UI styles
    └── chat.js                    # WebSocket client logic
```

## How It Works

- When a user sends a message, the WebSocket connection sends the message to the Spring Boot server.
- The Spring Boot server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.
- The client (JavaScript) listens for incoming messages and updates the chat UI in real-time.

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication**: Add authentication for users to join the chat room.
- **Private Messaging**: Allow users to send private messages to specific users.
- **Chat History**: Store and display previous messages when users join the chat.
- **File Sharing**: Enable users to share files in the chat.
